Credit Card Risk Detection using a neural network in PyTorch Framework.

Here are the steps I have followed:
    1. Performed EDA and any data preprocessing required (especially handle imbalance in the dataset).
    2. Implemented a Neural Network using PyTorch Framework
        a. Plotting training loss and validation loss
        b. Plotting training accuracy and validation accuracy
    3. Provided observations/reasoning where necessary and a conclusion section at the end of the notebook.
